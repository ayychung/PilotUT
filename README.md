Purpose of the Pilot UT: 
The purpos of the UT was to test what I thought were major problems with the website. This allowed me to see if the problems that I saw were or were not a problem for another person, such as if they could navigate the website properly, find specified material, and send certain information through the website. The heuristic evaluation showed to me major problems with the usability of the site, and the UT helped to confirm those issues.

Summary:
I learned that the person I tried the Pilot UT on had some similar problems as I did and also some problems that I did not encounter. I also found it interesting that even though my subject took a while to find information, he rated that it was still easy to find when he filled out the survey. It's interesting to see the different ways that people interact with the website, and how easily they were willing to give up if they were not allowed to use the control F button. Many people use this strategy to find things on webpages but relying simply on good design to find information proved to be a struggle. Everything went well except for one part where my subject gave up on finding a piece of information that he had to read for. I want to improve by asking for questions that require more digging into the website, where the subject has to interact with the interface more.
